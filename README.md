Advanced Dank Memer self-bot! Supports slash commands, incredibly strong, reliable and easy to use.
Instructions:
  1. Install NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
  2. Open Command Prompt console right in the self-bot directory, install the necessary packages by 'npm install package.json'.
  3. Check the config.json file, adjust the stats on your own.
  4. Open the token.txt file, fill the tokens in this form:
       channelId1 token1 // Use a single space to separate the two values.
       channelId2 token2 // and so on...
Now it's ready to use. Make sure to give credit to https://github.com/TahaGorme/slashy. I'll be the maintainer of their code on my project.
Give me a star if you find this easy to use! See more on the original bot Slashy.
